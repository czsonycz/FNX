Project Name: Funky Fenix Token (FNX)
1. Introduction
Funky Fenix (FNX) is a new entertainment token launched on December 11, 2024. This token combines the cryptocurrency world with creative competitions and entertaining content. Funky Fenix (FNX) is part of a broader ecosystem that includes regular videos, competitions for the best NFT drawings by participants, and a planned game where users will be able to spend or mine FNX tokens. The project aims to bring fun and creativity to the world of cryptocurrencies and NFTs, even for users who are not yet part of the crypto community.

2. Problem the Project Solves
In the cryptocurrency world, there is often a lack of entertaining and creative projects that genuinely engage a wider audience. Many projects focus only on technical aspects or investment opportunities, while Funky Fenix (FNX) focuses on the combination of art, competitions, and gamification. This approach creates an engaging and interactive environment for those interested in cryptocurrencies, art, and competitions.

3. Solution
Funky Fenix (FNX) is a token that functions within a unique platform combining competitions for the best NFT drawings. Although the first video will be released around Christmas 2024 without a competition due to a small community, from the next videos onwards, there will be competitions for participants to create the best NFT drawings. NFTs created in these competitions will then be auctioned, and some will be awarded to FNX token holders as special rewards.

Each video release will be associated with the burning of a certain number of FNX tokens, which helps maintain a deflationary model and reduces the total supply of tokens in circulation. Competitions for the best NFT will regularly occur, with the percentage of rewards for participants decreasing each year. This ensures the long-term growth of FNX token value, similar to Bitcoin’s halving model.

NFTs created in the competitions will be auctioned, and some will be distributed to those who hold FNX tokens, motivating the community to hold tokens long-term.

4. Tokenomics
Max Supply: 20,000,000,000 FNX tokens
Distribution:
Competitions for the Best NFT: 10% of the tokens will be reserved for competition participants as rewards.
Token Burning: 1% of the total FNX supply will be burned with each video release, helping to maintain a deflationary model.
Halving Model: The reward for participants will decrease by 10% annually, ensuring the project’s economy remains strong and FNX token value increases.
